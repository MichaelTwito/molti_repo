# Pilot Offer — Invoice Extraction (PromptPrecision)

## What you get (2-week pilot)
1) **Accuracy scorecard** on your invoices (200–500 docs)
2) Validated JSON output (strict schema)
3) Confidence + review queue (low-confidence only)
4) Export to CSV (optional: QuickBooks/Xero push)

## How it works
- Week 1: ingest historical invoices → run baseline vs improved config → deliver scorecard
- Week 2: shadow-mode processing → measure review rate + operational fit

## Deliverables
- JSON schema + sample outputs
- Eval report (schema validity, doc pass rate, review rate, latency, cost)
- Failure modes + recommended next steps

## Pricing
- **$1,000 pilot fee** (creditable toward first month if you convert)

## Success criteria (example)
- >= 98% schema validity
- >= 90% doc pass rate on required fields
- <= 15% review rate

## Data handling
- Minimal retention, encrypted storage, delete on request.
