# SynthCopilot (Vital/Serum)

## One-liner
Text → synth patch + performance macros → MIDI/DAW mapping. Make a synth feel like an instrument instantly.

## Component ideas (from brainstorm)
- Text→Patch (describe sound → parameter set/preset + explanation + variations)
- Reverse patch (audio → estimated patch + tuning guide)
- Smart preset librarian (search 20k presets by text/similarity)
- Manual-to-action for hardware synths
- Eurorack patch planner
- MIDI mapping agent (8 knobs that matter)

## Proposed combined product
**Vital/Serum Text→Patch + Macros→MIDI mapping** (8-knob performance page).

## MVP (minimum “magic”)
A) **Text→Patch for Vital-first**
- Input: “plucky techno bass, mono, snappy, slight grit, cutoff via envelope”
- Output: preset + 3 variations + macro assignments (cutoff, env amount, drive, etc.).

B) **Macro→MIDI mapping (Ableton-first)**
- Output as a simple “mapping recipe” (later: export mapping files).

## Pricing sketch
- Free tier (limited generations, no export)
- $9–$15/mo (export + library)
- One-time packs ($49–$99) by genre + mapping templates

## GTM
Short demo videos + Reddit/Discord (Vital/Serum/Ableton) + micro-influencers.

## Key risks
- Preset format + parameter mapping quality (must feel usable, not random).
- Device-verification/bot blocks if using web scraping for metadata.
