# Review convergence (meta)

Decision rule (Rick): keep iterating with independent reviewers until **contracts are closed**.
"Contracts" means:
- API contract (endpoints, request/response schemas, idempotency, limits)
- Data model contract (versioning, retention, invariants)
- Non-functional requirements (SLOs, rate limits, payload caps, security boundaries)
- Clear enforcement boundaries + RBAC

This file is updated after each round with:
- round id
- what changed
- judge decision: continue / stop / needs Rick decision

## Round 3 decision
- Judge: CONTINUE (AOD, Music Agents); SynthCopilot needed Rick decision.
- Rick decision: CONTINUE.
