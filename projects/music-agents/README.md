# Music industry agents

A set of workflow-first agents with measurable outcomes.

## Ideas
1) **Playlisting/outreach agent** (pragmatic)
- Research playlists/curators per track, craft tailored pitches, manage follow-ups + lightweight CRM.
- Buyer: indie artists, small labels, managers.
- KPI: playlist placements / response rate.

2) **Rights & royalties ops agent** (B2B, $$$)
- Collect contracts/splits/ISRC/ISWC, detect inconsistencies, create submission checklists, reminders.
- Buyer: labels, publishers, catalog owners.
- KPI: recovered/accelerated royalties, fewer disputes.

3) **A&R scouting agent**
- Scan TikTok/YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify signals, build reports (growth/geo/similarity), draft outreach.
- Buyer: labels, agencies.

4) **Tour/show ops agent**
- Manage venues, riders, schedules, threads, “what’s done vs pending”.
- Buyer: managers, bookers, production.

5) **Content machine w/ measurement**
- Generate clips/captions, A/B test, calendar + performance loop.
- Buyer: artists, social managers.

## Recommendation (if speed-to-revenue)
Start with **Playlisting/outreach** or **Tour ops**: short sales cycle, clear ROI, MVP possible without heavy integrations.

## Open questions
- B2B vs B2C focus?
- Distribution advantage (access to musicians) vs cold-start?
