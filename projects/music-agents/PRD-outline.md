# Music Agents — PRD outline (recommended wedges)

## Recommended wedge order
1) **Playlisting / Outreach Agent** (fastest to revenue)
2) **Rights & Royalties Ops Agent** (higher-$, more defensible, longer sales)

---

## Wedge A: Playlisting / Outreach Agent (MVP)
### Problem
Indie teams waste time finding relevant playlists/curators and doing consistent personalized outreach + follow-ups.

### ICP
Indie artists, managers, small labels (1–20 roster). Freelance promo/publicists.

### KPIs
Response rate, placement rate, time-to-first-response, qualified curators per track, deliverability/bounce, pipeline velocity.

### Core flow
Track intake → curator discovery → pitch drafting → send + follow-up → outcome tracking.

### MVP features
- Campaign per track
- Curator/playlist discovery (start with Spotify API + manual/CSV import + enrichment)
- CRM (status, notes, history)
- Pitch templates + AI draft + user approve
- Gmail integration + basic sequences (2 follow-ups) + stop on reply
- Simple dashboard + activity log

### V1+
Multi-channel, A/B subject lines, placement detection polling, team collaboration/approvals.

## Wedge B: Rights & Royalties Ops
### Problem
Splits/contracts/IDs inconsistent → delayed/missing royalties and disputes.

### MVP features
- Catalog intake (CSV + docs)
- Extraction + review UI
- Validation rules + issue tracker
- Checklist/tasks + reminders
- Export packages

## Open questions
- B2C vs B2B first?
- Email-only MVP acceptable?
- Data sources (Spotify-only vs providers like Chartmetric/Songstats)?
